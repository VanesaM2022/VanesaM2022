      <p>There are various factors that can contribute to mental health problems such as truama, chronic diseases, COVID-19, school, home life, etc. Often times mental health issues are overlooked because of the fear of being seen as weak or the fear of being seen as "mentally ill" and judged by the people around you. Together we can give "mental health" a new meaning.</p>
